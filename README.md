# Random Dog Breed Info

## Overview

Welcome to the **Random Dog Breed Info** project! This application is designed to retrieve information about various dog breeds using APIs. It is built with React and follows best practices, including the use of environment variables and animation libraries like Bootstrap and Animate.css.

## Features

- **API Integration**: Fetches data from a public API to display information about different dog breeds.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap for a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Animations**: Incorporates Animate.css for smooth transitions and engaging animations.
- **Environment Variables**: Uses `.env` files to securely manage API keys and other sensitive data.
